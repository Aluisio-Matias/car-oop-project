# CAR OOP PROJECT 

Part One
Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:
make, model and year
Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called honk, which returns the string “Beep.”

Part Two
Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.

Part Three
Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”

Part Four
Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called vehicles which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called capacity which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty; you only need to provide the capacity.

A garage should also have an add method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”
